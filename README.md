## cstring
<p align="justify">
cstring is a thread safe library written in C that allows programmers to create and build strings in a similar fashion to higher level programming languages. Memory for each string is tracked by the library, thus requiring no manual memory management for any strings created. All attributes of each string are accesible to the programmer and can be safely accessed and modified using the appropriate library functions. Programmers also have support from the library's built in argument validation which is able to catch potentially fatal errors related to cstring function calls before they can happen, thereby simplifying the debugging process.

<p align="justify">
The cstring library can be used by including it in any C program as <code>#include "cstring.h"</code> and compiling it as part of your build.
