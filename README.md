## cstring
<p align="justify">
cstring is a thread safe library written in C that allows programmers to create and build strings in a similar fashion to higher level programming languages such as Python and Java. Memory for each string is tracked by the library, thus requiring no manual memory management by the user for any strings they create. All attributes of each string are accesible to the programmer and can be safely modified using the appropriate library functions. Programmers also have support from the library's built in argument validation which is able to catch potentially fatal errors related to cstring function calls before they can happen, thereby simplifying the debugging process.

The cstring library can be used by including it in any C program as <code>#include "cstring.h"</code> assuming it is in the same directory as your program.
