## cstring
<p align="justify">
cstring is a thread safe C library that allows programmers to create and build strings in a similar fashion to high level programming languages such as Python and Java. Memory for each string is managed by the library, requiring no manual allocation or deallocation of memory by the user for the strings they create. Nonetheless, all attributes of each string are accesible to the programmer and can be safely modified and deallocated using the appropriate library functions. Programmers also have support from the library's built in argument validation which is able to catch fatal errors related to cstring function calls before they result in a fatal error and thus simplifying the debugging process.

The cstring library can be used by including it in any C program as <code>#include "cstring.h"</code>.
