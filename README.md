## cstring
<p align="justify">
cstring is a thread safe C library that allows programmers to create and build strings in a similar fashion to higher level programming languages such as Python and Java. Memory is dynamically allocated at runtime and automatically freed on exit, requiring no manual allocation or deallocation of memory by the user for the strings they create. Nonetheless, all attributes of each cstring are accesible to the programmer and can be safely modified and deallocated using the appropriate library functions. Programmers also have support from the library's built in argument validation which is able to catch fatal errors related to cstring before they result in an error and thus simplifying the debugging process.

The cstring library can be used by including it in any C program as <code>#include "cstring.h"</code>.
